# Testing Blazor Components with FizzBuzz 
## Setting up your VisualStudio Environment
1. Clone the current repository to your desired location
2. Clone this project git@github.com:turtle-tortue/BlazorUnitTestingPrototype.git
3. Add the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Testing.csproj project as a reference in the current solution

## FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a programming challenge that has the following rules.
- For a loop going from 1 to 100
- Everytime a number is divisible by 3 print Fizz
- Everytime a number is divisible by 5 print Buzz
- Everytime a number is divisble by 3 and by 5 print FizzBuzz
- Otherwise print the number

## Before you get started
- Run the application to get familiar with it.
- Note that everytime Fizz printed in a paragraph tag it must contain the class Fizz
- Note that everytime Buzz printed in a paragraph tag it must contain the class Buzz
- Note that everytime Fizz printed in a paragraph tag it must contain the class FizzBuzz
- Note that everytime a number is printed in a paragraph tag it must contain the class Number
